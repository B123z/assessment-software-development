# Learning Notes


1) Through this project I mastered the usage of css layout patterns to structure a webpage such as the CSS flexbox. I used Flexbox to:

-Align navigation items horizontally

-Create a two-column hero section

-Center content both vertically and horizontally

-Distribute elements evenly across sections


2) I also applied the principle of responsive design by writing a media query to make  the webpage still readable on different devices with different viewports.
